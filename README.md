# Document Analysis

A lightweight LLM-based tool for document analysis. Upload PDFs or text files and ask questions to get AI-powered insights, summaries, and key information.

## 🚀 Features

- **Upload & Analyze Documents:** Easily upload PDF or text files for analysis.
- **AI-powered Q&A & Summarization:** Get answers to your questions and summaries generated by advanced AI models.
- **Fast & User-friendly:** Simple web interface for quick interactions.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangChain** – for orchestrating document processing and LLM interactions.
- **mistral API** – for enabling advanced natural language processing and understanding.
- **Streamlit** – for building an interactive, web-based user interface.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Experience the application at [ai-doc-reader.streamlit.app](https://ai-doc-reader.streamlit.app/)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Document Upload:**  
   Users upload PDF or plain text documents through the Streamlit interface.

2. **Text Extraction:**  
   The backend parses and extracts text from the uploaded files.

3. **LLM Processing:**  
   Extracted content is passed through LangChain pipelines, which interact with the OpenAI API to:
   - Summarize content
   - Answer user questions
   - Extract key information

4. **User Interaction:**  
   Results (summaries, answers, highlights) are displayed immediately in the Streamlit app.

## 📐 Architecture

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with Streamlit, providing a modern, reactive UI for uploads and queries.

- **Backend:**  
  Python-based, using LangChain to structure LLM tasks and OpenAI for processing. The backend handles:
  - File parsing and validation
  - Query routing to LLM
  - Result formatting

- **Extensibility:**  
  The project is modular, allowing easy integration of new LLM providers, custom analytics, or additional file formats.

## 💡 Future Plans

- Support for analyzing multiple documents simultaneously.
- Enhanced NLP analytics (topic modeling, entity extraction).
- Exportable analysis reports.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sayeem3051/document-analysis.git
    cd document-analysis
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
    - Requires Python 3.9+.
    - Install common dependencies (exact requirements file not detected, but typical packages are):
      ```bash
      pip install streamlit langchain openai
      ```
3. **Configure OpenAI API Key**
    - Obtain your API key from [mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys).
    - Set it as an environment variable:
      ```bash
      export mistral_API_KEY='your-api-key'
      ```

4. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    *(Replace `app.py` with the main script name if different.)*
